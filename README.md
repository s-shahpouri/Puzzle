## 📖 About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles released every day from December 1st to December 25th. The puzzles vary in difficulty and cover a wide range of topics, from algorithm design to data parsing. 

You don't need a computer science background to participate; just a little programming knowledge and problem-solving skills will get you far!
