# Puzzle
This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles from Advent of Code, an annual event of programming challenges designed for a variety of skill levels. Each puzzle is solved in Python, and solutions are organized by year and day for easy navigation. This repo is a personal project to improve my problem-solving skills!
