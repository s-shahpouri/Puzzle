## 📖 About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles released every day from December 1st to December 25th. The puzzles vary in difficulty and cover a wide range of topics, from algorithm design to data parsing. 

You don't need a computer science background to participate; just a little programming knowledge and problem-solving skills will get you far!

Start with the examples in the puzzle description to validate your solution.
If you're stuck, break the problem into smaller parts.
Remember, it's about learning and having fun—don't stress too much!
📌 Notes
These solutions are my personal approaches to the puzzles and may not be the most optimized.
Please do not copy puzzle text or input files directly into your repository (per Advent of Code's guidelines).
